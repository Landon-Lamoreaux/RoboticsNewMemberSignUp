# Robotics New Members
This is a simple application to generate an SDSMT (South Dakota School of Mines and Technology) student email and add it to a list. This was created as an easy way for students to sign up for the Rocker Robotics team. There is also the option for new members to enter their whole email manualy in case they want to use another email.
